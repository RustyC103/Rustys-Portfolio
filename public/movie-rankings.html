 <h1>The Best Movies According to Rusty</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>How To Train Your Dragon (Trilogy)</h3>
 <p>This is my favorite movie (trilogy) of all time. I'll be real; I can't dim it down to just ONE of them! They're all way too good for that. The visuals, the amazing soundtrack written by John Powell, the writing, all of it is absolutely perfect, despite being so different from its source material. (Yes, there's a HTTYD book series. It's WAY different, especially Toothless!)</p>
<h3>Wolf Children</h3>
<p>While so many animated films from the 2010s are masterpieces, I feel like this one takes the cake. Its emotional, heartfelt, and has a brilliant story focusing on loss, grief, and coming to accept yourself and shape your future into the way you want it to be! 10/10 Would recommend.</p>
<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>When someone says Avatar, you might think "the last airbender," or you might think of the absolutely stunning film that James Cameron produced late 2009. In this case, I'm talking about the latter. This movie is so incredibly immersive and emotional and the visuals are just downright stunning. Perfect Sci-fi film where it also holds onto the sense of realism, making you question if its really fiction at all.</p>
