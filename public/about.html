<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Rusty, a creative problem-solver with a background in digital art and a growing passion for web development. After nearly a decade of freelance work in visual storytelling, I’ve shifted my focus toward building clean, accessible, and user-friendly websites that bring ideas to life.</p>

<p>Through self-guided learning and hands-on projects, I’ve been developing skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design. I enjoy the challenge of turning visual concepts into fully functional websites, especially when it means improving the way people interact with digital content.</p>

<p>Whether I’m coding layouts, optimizing for performance, or experimenting with new tools and frameworks, I’m always looking to create meaningful, engaging experiences on the web. I’m currently looking for opportunities to grow as a developer, collaborate with other creatives, and continue building my skills one project at a time.</p>
